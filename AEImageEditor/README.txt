Ascii Engine Image Editor!

This program can create images in ascii art quickly and easily. Art files created with this image editor are in the format .AEArt and can be loaded by AsciiEngine with the LoadAllArtAssets function (which loads all .AEArt files within a given directory). In order to draw an image within AsciiEngine loaded by LoadAllArtAssets simply call WriteImageToScreen and supply the file name of the image!
